# Epix

Epics without [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/).

## Why?

Epics are a very strong pattern to build maintainable applications with RxJS. They were pioneered by redux-observable, which forces you to use Redux. Epix is for all the cases where you manage your state without Redux.

## Install

```sh
npm install epix
```

or

```sh
yarn add epix
```
